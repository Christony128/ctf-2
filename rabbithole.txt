Bunny (wide-eyed, whispering): Dad… Dad… DAD!

Father Rabbit (calmly chewing clover): If this is about the carrot shortage again—

Bunny: A HUMAN JUST CRAWLED INTO OUR BURROW!!!

Father Rabbit (freezes mid-chew): …I’m sorry, what?

Bunny: A huge one! No fur, weird ears, only two legs! It bent down and went shhhhhlorp right into Tunnel Three!

Father Rabbit (drops clover): Tunnel Three is the guest tunnel, not the human tunnel!

Bunny: I KNOW! I tried to look brave but my tail betrayed me!

Father Rabbit (panicking but trying to stay composed): Okay. Okay. We trained for this. What do we do when encountering a large unknown creature?

Bunny: Play dead?

Father Rabbit: No, that’s opossums. Think!

Bunny: Zig-zag escape pattern?

Father Rabbit: Good, good. And if escape is blocked?

Bunny (thinking hard): Offer them a carrot in peace?

Father Rabbit: …Honestly, at this point, that might work.

Bunny: Dad, what if it wants to adopt me?

Father Rabbit: Then we negotiate visitation rights.

Bunny (peeking down tunnel): It’s making strange noises… like “aww” and “cute.”

Father Rabbit (relieved): Oh thank the Great Lettuce. That’s a friendly human.

Bunny: Friendly?

Father Rabbit: Yes. Dangerous humans shout. Friendly ones say “aww.” Still unpredictable, but lower risk.

Bunny: So… we’re not moving burrows?

Father Rabbit: Not yet. But we are absolutely installing a “No Humans Beyond This Point” sign.

Bunny: Do humans read bunny signs?

Father Rabbit: No idea. But it’ll make me feel better.

Bunny: Dad?

Father Rabbit: Yes, son?

Bunny: It’s holding a carrot.

Father Rabbit: That might be a green flag

Bunny: flag? I saw a flag

Father Rabbit: There's flags in plain sight everywhere

Bunny: No but this one was near a bear cave

Father Rabbit: Don't go near the bear cave

Bunny: But I thought this was a safe environment

Father Rabbit (low voice): Nothing is completely safe… that’s why we never leave important things out in the open.

Bunny: Then where do we keep them?

Father Rabbit (glancing toward the darker tunnels): That's for you to learn on your own
